    <!-- STORY -->
    <div class="container">
      <p>Governor Kathy Hochul announced last month that $2 million would be spent on mobile units for distributing medications which treat substance use disorder, like methadone and buprenorphine. That comes as data shows overdose deaths from opioids spiked in New York state during the pandemic. Mobile treatments are meant to reach patients in more rural parts of the state, where opioid treatment programs are harder to access. </p>

      <p>Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the NIH, said the data in New York confirms a nationwide trend. "The reality is that during the COVID pandemic, drug use increased enormously," she said. "The stress from the pandemic has led to a rise in drug consumption."</p>

    <!-- KICKER -->
    <div class="container footer">
    <p>In another effort to reach more patients, New York relaxed its requirements for which patients can receive take-home methadone. Normally, patients must receive their dose at a clinic daily, but take-home doses were expanded to allow social distancing at facilities. Researchers say that thus far, the program has had strong patient outcomes. </p>
